We have multiple openings for graduate students. 
PhD students
PhD students receive mentored research experience and guidance in conducting independent research. At INSPIRE Lab, PhD students are encouraged to take data science courses to stay at the forefront of the field and apply technical expertise to brain science research. Projects involve developing machine/statistical/deep learning models and novel analyses for neuroimaging data. 
Eligibility: We can only recruit PhD students admitted to UMD's BioE, ECE, or NACS programs. If you're interested in joining us, please apply to one of these PhD programs.
Master students
If you are admitted to any of the data science-related master's programs at UMD College Park and are interested in conducting research projects or a thesis in INSPIRE Lab, please contact me.
Eligible graduate students, please email me with your CV and transcript.
