We have multiple openings for graduate students. If eligible (see criteria below), please email me your CV and transcript.
* **PhD students**: PhD students receive mentored research experience and guidance in conducting independent research. At INSPIRE Lab, PhD students are encouraged to take data science courses to stay at the forefront of the field and apply technical expertise to brain science research. Projects involve developing machine/statistical/deep learning models and novel analyses for neuroimaging data. If you're interested in joining us, please apply and get admitted to one of UMD's PhD programs, such as BioE, ECE, or NACS. We can recruit students from these and other departments, but admission is required first.

* **Master students**: If you are admitted to any of the data science-related master's programs at UMD College Park and are interested in conducting research projects or a thesis in INSPIRE Lab, please contact me.
